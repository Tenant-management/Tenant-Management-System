#TENANT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
This is the Groups Repository for the Project,Tenant Management system.
##Introduction
This Project will enable the landlord to manage and maintain rental bills without using a lot of effort or personnel. There always exists a need to check for information organization especially when it comes to financial as well as keep record of an already client information for future reference. Therefore, the rental management system is imperative as its acts as an auxiliary to effectively manage real estate resources and to provide optimal service for clients.
With the current system recording the details of various activities of user is completely manual and entails a lot of paper work. each house has a file that contains the house,number, size, rent per month, expected deposit, occupant and status. Rent payment table contains tenants, first name, last name, Phone number, date of payment, amount and balance if any. The existing system only provides text-based interface which is not as user friendly as graphical user interface. Since the system is implemented manually; the response is very slow. The transactions are not secure as papers may get lost or damaged. Hence, there is need of reformation of the system with more advantages and flexibility. The system eliminates most of the limitations of the existing system.
